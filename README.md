# Kariton: A Mobile and Web-Based Solution for Recycling in a Circular Economy

Recent research shows that a reward-based scheme can effectively promote waste segregation and recycling. It has been demonstrated that monetary incentives such as pay-as-you-throw programs raise sorted-to-total waste ratios by 17% [3]. This research focuses on developing a system that connects the community, barangays, small junk shops, and big junk shop. The aim is to provide incentives to the community for segregating their trash and recyclables. In this system, barangays will have an important role by collecting recyclable scrap materials from households within their area. In return for their efforts in segregating and providing recyclables, the community members will receive incentives. Which could be monetary or in the form of goods. Once the barangays collect recyclable scraps they will sell these materials to small junk shops. This transaction generates additional revenue for the barangays. Which can be reinvested in community projects also for further waste management initiatives. After acquiring the recyclable materials the small junk shops will then communicate with the big junk shop to sell scraps in bulk. These big junk shop, in turn, coordinate with recycling centers to ensure that the materials are being processed and repurposed effectively. By establishing a line of communication between junk shops and the barangay. The system ensures that recyclables are sold at a fair price that will benefit all parties involved. This integrated approach aims to create a sustainable and efficient waste management system that benefits the community by promoting environmental sustainability through effective recycling practices.
